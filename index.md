I created this blog to write about things that I find interesting or feel the need or urge to bring truth to the forefront.

An example is the increasing usage of artificial intelligence in creative pursuits like art without questioning the actual requirement of it & whether it justifies the huge infrastructure investments it entails for that usage. Another layered example is about the characters of the Mahabharata. I find many misconceptions & misinterpretations of the morally grey characters like Bhishma, Karna, Krishna, Arjuna, virtually everyone in the story. I find the growing urge to simplify & box them into a stereotype very disturbing & a lot of nuance is lost in this compartnmentalization. I intend to clear those misconceptions because it is a favorite epic of mine, one that I have had a lot of fun reading since the childhood.

Don't expect consistency in topics, my interests are fluid & I hate compartmentalization as well as doing this just for profit. I am doing this because I believe that the truth needs to be out in the open.

This is me fulfilling my responsibility to give back to the world in which I was educated & am living, so that the present & the future generations can be more aware & make more informed decisions than us, if these blogs stay till the end of time. If not, I'm okay with them fading into oblivion as it happens with all things that are created.
